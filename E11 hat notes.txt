ren:

- out of school/work/hobbies/etc, most issues lie in
personal life, like needing sleep
- the things that take the most time out of sleep is work (getting up early) and school/studying (homework)
= to give more time for sleep, would take more time out
of school than work
- a lot of studio classwork, lots of projects = time consuming
- mostly digital schoolwork
- making project drafts, specifically choosing fonts takes a while.

problem statement:
Create a hat that simplifies the process of choosing fonts while designing.








hat kinda has a camera which scans the project you're 
working on, and on a little screen suggests typefaces 
and maybe provides them as previews with a picture
it takes
